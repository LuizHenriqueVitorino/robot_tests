    Given the API endpoint is available
    When a user requests product information with ID ${_id}
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should contain product name "Product 1"

When a user requests product information with ID ${_id}
    [Documentation]    Request product information with the given ID
    ${RESPONSE}    GET On Session    alias="Serverest"    url=${BASE_URL}/Produtos/${_id}
    Set Test Variable    ${RESPONSE}

Then the response status code should be 200
    [Documentation]    Verify that the response status code is 200
    ${status_code}    Set Variable    ${RESPONSE.status_code}
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${status_code}    200

And the response should contain product name "Product 1"
    [Documentation]    Verify that the response contains the expected product name
